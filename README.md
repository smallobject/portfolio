# Portfolio Site

This is the initial README.me file for the portfolio site, I will explain this as I build things out.

# Terminal

Terminal was created using a few different tools, Python, SVGs and React.

1. I installed `termtosvg` a Python package via PIP.
2. Fix the initial PATH export to handle WSL2.
3. Change the window_frame template to use ligature nerd fonts and fix UI colors for out therem.
4. We take the exported SVG and convert it to a React component using `react-svgr`
5. Add it to our project and fix positioning, size, font render, etc.

Overall it was quite fun trying to add a terminal to the site. I didn't want to use a GIf or anything image based so SVGs were really cool to work with.

In general the entire site is built only using SVGs.
